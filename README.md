# Influenza Infection Rates and Weather Patterns
__________________________________________

# About This Project
_________________


*In this project we looked at Flu infection rates and it's correlation with Weather patterns. To accomplish this, we looked at CDC flu infection rates and the NOAA weather API.
Once we cleaned the data we plotted the data and put togeter the analysis



# Analysis
________________

*Is there a relationship between weather and influenza infection? common knowledge of “flu season, and influenza vaccination timeline - get shots in fall for winter influenza spikes”. . .The why: to analyze weather and influenza data to observe the trend and conclude if this timeline is supported by data (fall vaccination timeline)
What is the seasonal pattern of influenza occurrence, ILI occurrence? Influenza occurrence: looking for patterns, is there a drastic difference between influenza rates in warmer weather vs colder weather? Influenza rates and season. . .The why: looking into how temperature affects influenza--> speculation/the why: is colder temperature decreasing our immune function significantly enough that infection rate with influenza is significant as compared to infection at warmer temperatures? Opportunistic infection + influenza preferential to colder temps ---- ILI occurrence: rates of recorded medically diagnosed influenza-like-illness, addressing non-laboratory confirmed cases . . . rates vs season

Do some locations have a higher occurrence of influenza relative to others per capita--if we can get this info? Addressing influenza infection rates in different states based on their location/weather patterns- do warmer states have differing infection rates than colder states?
Our analysus shows that there is a realtionship between colder weather and Flu infection rate.
